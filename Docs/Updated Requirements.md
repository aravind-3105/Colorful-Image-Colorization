## Project Requirements 

### Post Mid-eval Meetings

Following the meeting, there is a need to innovate and add novel contributions to the existing work. This can come at a compromise of reducing the amount of recreated results and experiments. 
The following tasks are considered:

- Recreate results for experiments, more specifically 3.1 (involving base colorization with 3 loss functions)
- Recreate results for object detection for imageNet in 3.2 (more specifically adding dense layers to each conv block and getting classification accuracy)
- Add novel result of benchmarking classification of outputted colourized images, as compared to greyscale and ground truth.
